1. Movement:
    a. Orbit mode: Click and drag the mouse to change azimuth and altitude. Scroll
       mouse wheel to move in and out from the center of the scene.
    b. Free mode: Click and drag to change pitch and yaw. Use WASD to move forward, backward, and side to side.
       Use E to move up, and Q to move down.
    c. Switching: Use either shift key to switch between free mode and orbit mode.

2. Light controls:
    a. Toggling lights: Press 1 to toggle the stationary light on and off. Press 2 to toggle the light attached to the camera.
    b. Moving the stationary light: Use the period key to increase the stationary light's radius from the center.
       Use the comma key to decrease the radius.
       Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the light about the center.
       Use the up and down arrow keys to move the light up and down.

3. Switching materials:
    Use the square bracket keys to cycle between materials.

4. Materials:
    1. The first material is the material specified in the assignment.
    2. The blue material is to demonstrate a less reflective surface with little specular component.
    3. The brown material is meant to resemble copper, because it has a bright specular component the same color as the material.
    4. The multicolor material is simply for clearly demonstrating the separate components (ambient, diffuse, and specular)
